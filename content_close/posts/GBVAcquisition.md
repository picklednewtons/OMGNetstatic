[GBV announced](https://gbv.capital/gbv-omg-synqa/) the acquisition of OMG Network early in December 2020 immediately followed by the old management team shipping out and the GBV guys coming in.

Some of the team at GBV jumped straight into the main [Telegram group](https://t.me/OmiseGo)  and started an open and refreshingly frank discussion with the community about where the OMG network stands, with a focus now on short-term wins while they define their longer term strategy for the network. Thanks Leslie, John & co for jumping in, I think it was much appreciated.

On December 9th the team made OMG available on the [Genesis Block Coinhere ATMs](https://omg.network/omg-token-coinhere-atm/) which seems a nice quick win to bring some more attention to the network. The Coinhere network is the largest Crypto ATM Network in Asia.

This was followed by the main [Telegram group](https://t.me/OmiseGo) moving to **official** status and the GBV team continue to engage the community there.
