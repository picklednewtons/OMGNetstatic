In July 2020 Reddit announced a competition titled [The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) and invited teams to demonstrate how their technology could provide the back-end for a Reddit points architecture on Ethereum mainnet.

> "tl;dr: Do you believe your Ethereum scaling technology can handle Reddit's scale? It's time to let the Ethereum community hear about it. Send your demo by July 31, 2020."

The OMG team duly stepped up with one of the [strongest proposals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i19us9/omg_networks_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff_proposal/), a virtual demo:

...proper documentation:

* [Github Project](https://github.com/omgnetwork/community-points) - an open-source project that can be reviewed by anyone
* [Technical Specs](http://docs.omg.network/use-cases/community-points) - documentation that meets all of the requirements by the Reddit team
* [Latest release](https://github.com/omgnetwork/community-points/releases) - the latest release of the project
* [User Guide](https://github.com/omgnetwork/community-points/wiki/User-Guide) - a step-by-step guide on how to use the demo application
* [Moderator Guide](https://github.com/omgnetwork/community-points/wiki/Moderator-Guide) - moderatorâ€™s instructions on how to manage tokens and interact with smart contracts via an intuitive dashboard provided by Curvegrid

...and the product actually working and configured for the [r/omgnetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/) reddit sub. The community duly jumped on and started slinging rocks (the points minted for the example) at each other, even Jun got in on the action:

Even if OMG don't win the bakeoff it's a great turnaround and demonstration of the team capabilities in a 4 week timeframe.
